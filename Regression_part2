## Data:

Different factors affect what an individual needs from a medical aid scheme, and these change 
over time. For this reason, some individuals tend to review their existing medical aid cover 
periodically and compare it with other medical aid schemes. Data from medical aid scheme 
records were available. This data looks at what factors increase the likelihood that individuals 
will change to a different medical aid scheme if provided information that the current medical 
aid scheme they use no longer meet their needs. 

## Outcome variable :
‘med_scheme’ is a binary indicator coded as 1 if there was a change from the current to a different medical aid 
scheme and 0 if there was no change. The main exposure was an individual’s perceived state 
of health (‘perceived_health’ coded as very poor, poor, good, and very good). Potential 
factors impacting the likelihood of changing were:

• charges – individual’s monthly cost billed by medical aid scheme 
• spouse – yes or no
• sex – sex of primary beneficiary (male or female)
• ages – age of primary beneficiary
